SHARANNYA, YOU COSMICALLY CONFUSED, EMOTIONALLY LAGGING, ACADEMICALLY ENDANGERED POKÉMON,

HAPPYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY BIRTHDAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 🎉🔥🦑🐸💀✨

Since your boards are approaching like a truck driven by a blindfolded kangaroo, and your love life has the plot development speed of a Snorlax on sleep mode, here is your birthday wish written by someone whose sanity did rage quit:

First of all —
Your one-sided love story is running on potato-powered WiFi 📡🥔.
That guy has less awareness than a calculator without batteries.
May he finally receive a divine firmware update and realize you exist.
If not, uninstall him. Reboot life.

Second —
Maths is staring at you like:
“solve me lol”
And you’re staring back like:
“bro I can’t even solve the mystery of my life” 💀📐
Physics?
That subject wakes up every morning just to bully you.
Chemistry?
The only bond you’re forming is with sadness.

Third —
You were sad recently.
Unacceptable.
I’m summoning the Intergalactic Happiness Lizard 🦎✨
He will bite your sadness away.
Side effects include: loud confidence, random laughing, and zero thoughts.

Here is your BIRTHDAY UNIVERSE PACK:
🧠 → Brain cell DLC (lag may occur)
📚 → Books (just for shelf decoration, let’s be real)
💘 → Love story patch notes (bug fixes pending)
🎂 → Cake (now 87% less likely to fall)
🦕 → Dinosaur to chase away your crush if needed
🔨 → Hammer to fix your life (incorrect usage guaranteed)
🔋 → Motivation battery (dies in 3 minutes)
🛐 → Prayer circle for passing boards
📢 → A megaphone to scream about your existence
🧍🧍‍♂️ → You & your crush but in parallel universes
🌪️ → Tornado of emotional instability (limited edition)

May this year bless you with:
• Marks that don’t resemble your heartbeat under stress
• Confidence louder than your teachers shouting your name
• A crush who stops behaving like a background process
• Happiness that stays longer than your attention span
• And enough brain power to survive Class 10 without becoming a mythological creature

Okay that’s it.
Happy Birthday you beautifully chaotic glitch in the matrix 🎉🔥🌈🦑
Now go shine. Or explode.
Either works.
BYEEEE>>>>><<</;
